<h2>Home page for an experimental website displaying COVID-19 statistics</h2>

The data is displayed in a large table showing for each day the increase or decrease in cases in the previous week. Most cases reported on a date are from a test that took place in the previous four days. Using the reporting date gives more up to date figures but creates blips. Using the date the test was performed gives a smoother display but the last four days are greyed out.
